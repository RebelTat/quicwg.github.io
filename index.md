## Upcoming Meetings

We have scheduled an [interim meeting in Zurich](https://github.com/quicwg/wg-materials/blob/master/interim-20-02/arrangements.md), on 5-6 February 2020. After that, will be meeting at [IETF 107 in Vancouver](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/107/).

## Our Documents

Our initial documents cover different aspects of the 'core' QUIC protocol, and also define a mapping of HTTP semantics to it.

## Implementing QUIC

We have a number of [experimental implementations](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/wiki/Implementations) in progress. The current goal for interop testing is the [14th Implementation Target](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/wiki/14th-Implementation-Draft).

Implementers should join the [quicdev Slack](https://quicdev.slack.com/) to coordinate testing; contact the [WG chairs](mailto:quic-chairs@ietf.org) for an invitation. Note that discussions on Slack are considered IETF contributions under "Note Well".
